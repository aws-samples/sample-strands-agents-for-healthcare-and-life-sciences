# strands-agents-for-healthcare-and-life-sciences

In these sample notebooks you will explore how agentic workflows powered by Strands framework and large language models on Amazon Bedrock can enhance complex oncology research. You will learn how AI-driven agents leverage planning, tool-use, and self-reflection to transform intricate research queries into actionable insights.

## Prerequisites

- Amazon SageMaker Studio with JupyterLab environment or a SageMaker Notebook environment.

## Setup Instructions

1. These notebooks were designed to run with Amazon SageMaker Studio. To use Studio, you will need to setup a SageMaker Domain. For instructions on how to onboard to a Sagemaker domain, refer to this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-studio-onboard.html).
2. With the SageMaker domain created, you have to create a **JupyterLab space**. We recommend an instance size of **ml.t3.large** and at least **50 GB** of storage.

## Usage Instructions

1. On SageMaker Studio, open the JupyterLab environment.
2. Clone this repository or manually import all files from this project into your workspace.
3. To setup the environment, first run notebook [00-setup_environment.ipynb](00-setup_environment.ipynb).
4. Labs 1 to 5 are typically executed in order, but you can run them independently.
5. Follow the instructions on each notebook to run the cells. Some of the notebooks will have a Setup section in the beginning with additional installation instructions.
